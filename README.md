- Project Overview

In this project, I worked with a dataset containing FIFA player information, including attributes such as age, nationality, overall rating, skill ratings, and more. The primary objectives of this project were:

Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.
Conducting exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the player attributes and their distributions.
Visualizing key relationships and trends within the dataset.
Extracting relevant information to answer specific research questions.
Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is a crucial step in any data analysis project. In this project, I implemented various techniques to ensure data quality and consistency. The data cleaning process included:

Handling missing values: Identifying missing values and employing strategies such as imputation or removal.
Handling duplicates: Identifying and removing duplicate entries in the dataset.
Handling inconsistent data: Resolving inconsistencies or errors in data representation.
Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in understanding the underlying patterns and characteristics of the dataset. In this project, I performed EDA on the FIFA player data to gain insights and answer relevant questions. The EDA process involved:

Summarizing and visualizing player attributes such as age, nationality, overall rating, skill ratings, and more.
Analyzing the distribution of player attributes.
Exploring relationships between attributes through correlation analysis.
Investigating specific research questions using appropriate statistical measures and visualizations.
Technologies Used

The project was implemented using the following technologies:

Python: The primary programming language for data cleaning, data analysis, and visualization.
Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.
Seaborn:
Matplotlib: A popular data visualization library in Python.

# 🚀 Exciting Portfolio Project 2: Glassdoor Data Cleaning! 📊💼

I am thrilled to share my latest portfolio project, which involved working with Glassdoor data and implementing robust data cleaning techniques. As a data enthusiast, I believe that clean and accurate data forms the foundation for meaningful analysis and valuable insights. 🧹💻

For this project, I dived into the Glassdoor dataset, which provided a treasure trove of information about company reviews, salaries, interview experiences, and more. However, before extracting valuable insights, I knew that the data needed to undergo a comprehensive cleaning process to ensure its reliability and consistency. 📈🔍

Using Python, I implemented a series of data-cleaning techniques to address missing values, handle outliers, and standardize variables. I also employed techniques such as data imputation, outlier detection, and feature scaling to ensure the integrity of the dataset. This meticulous cleaning process was essential in preparing the data for subsequent analysis and visualization. 📊✨

Throughout the project, I utilized powerful Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to perform data manipulation and visualization tasks. I created visually compelling charts, graphs, and plots to present the cleaned data effectively. These visualizations not only enhanced the understanding of the dataset but also provided actionable insights for decision-making. 📊📈

One of the most intriguing aspects of this project was the ability to uncover trends and patterns within the Glassdoor dataset. By analyzing company reviews, salaries, and other factors, I gained valuable insights into the job market, company cultures, and employee experiences. These findings have immense value for job seekers, employers, and industry professionals alike. ⚡💼

I am proud to present my Glassdoor Data Cleaning project on my GitHub repository, where you can find the detailed code and documentation. Feel free to explore the repository and gain insights into my data cleaning process and the resulting visualizations. Your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated! 🙌🔗
