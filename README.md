Project Overview

In this project, I worked with a dataset containing FIFA player information, including attributes such as age, nationality, overall rating, skill ratings, and more. The primary objectives of this project were:

Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.
Conducting exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the player attributes and their distributions.
Visualizing key relationships and trends within the dataset.
Extracting relevant information to answer specific research questions.
Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is a crucial step in any data analysis project. In this project, I implemented various techniques to ensure data quality and consistency. The data cleaning process included:

Handling missing values: Identifying missing values and employing strategies such as imputation or removal.
Handling duplicates: Identifying and removing duplicate entries in the dataset.
Handling inconsistent data: Resolving inconsistencies or errors in data representation.
Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in understanding the underlying patterns and characteristics of the dataset. In this project, I performed EDA on the FIFA player data to gain insights and answer relevant questions. The EDA process involved:

Summarizing and visualizing player attributes such as age, nationality, overall rating, skill ratings, and more.
Analyzing the distribution of player attributes.
Exploring relationships between attributes through correlation analysis.
Investigating specific research questions using appropriate statistical measures and visualizations.
Technologies Used

The project was implemented using the following technologies:

Python: The primary programming language for data cleaning, data analysis, and visualization.
Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.
Seaborn:
Matplotlib: A popular data visualization library in Python.
